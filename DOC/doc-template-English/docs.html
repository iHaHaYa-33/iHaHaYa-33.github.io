      <h2> Getting Started</h2>
      <h3 id="introduction"> Introduction</h3>
      <p> The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of traditional folk dance and music of Amaggunju of Uganda, and present how it is experienced in the world. This paper is based on my experiences learning, performing, observing and reflecting on the Dance of Amaggunju in three different countries: China, Uganda and the United States, specifically New York. I will share my reflective learning around the  traditional music dance Amaggunju in the three countries, and share ideas for lessons and idea for how to teach this art form in China.

        <li>How Amaggunju dance came to become a royal dance</li>

      <h3 id="movement"> How Amaggunju dance got its movement vocabulary</h3>
      <p>Ggunju, the king’s uncle, was from the Mashroom (obutiko) clan. So with his clans men from the mushroom clan (ab’obutiko), he created kicking and jumping movements. They danced so vigorously, which made the king happy. The movements were later adapted into a dance — the Amaggunju dance which was performed whenever they wanted to make king happy. Therefore, this is why Amaggunju got its name from Ggunju, the man who started the dance (i.e. Ma-Ggunju — the dance of Ggunju)</p>

      <h3 id="further"> Further development of Amaggunju dance</h3>
      <p>Amaggunju dance was later adopted as a way to protect the king from the approaching crowds that usually appeared to watch the dance. Many times, when the dance was being performed, many people gathered to watch and be entertained to this dance. So Ggunju and his performers, as a way to keep the crowds from squeezing in on the king, would kick higher and further to keep the crowds at a distance. In addition, when the king was moving about the kingdom, the dancers led him so as to keep the people at a distance.</p>

      <h3 id="royal"> How Amaggunju dance came to become a royal dance</h3>
      <p>One day, while the dancers were performing, an unidentified man came to watch the dance. He was holding a spear which was later identified to belong to the late Kabaka Nakibinge, who was the father to the new king . This man was arrested and accused of killing the Kabaka. The man, as a way to protect himself, took them to place where he picked the spear. Here they found a hole (a hunters trap for animals) in which the king had fallen and died. So from this place the bones of the king were taken and given a decent burial. From this time on, they started treasuring this dance because it helped them to discover the bones of their king. </p>

      <h3 id="social"> How Amaggunju dance became a social dance</h3>
      <p>Amaggunju dance was originally performed only as a royal dance. It later became a social dance. This came about in 1966 when a new President Dr. Apollo Milton Obote came into power and abolished kingship. It is remembered that he (Obote) forced Kabaka Mutesa into exile. This act also forced the performers and royal people to leave the palace. As a result, the dance began to be performed outside the palace on social functions and it became a social dance.</p>

      <h2> Amaggunju in</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Uganda</li>
        <li>the USA</li>
        <li>China</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="uganda"> Amaggunju in Uganda</h3>
      <p>The spread of Amaggunju in Uganda is full of vitality, but it is primitive. On the one hand, at the place where folk dance was born, the students and teachers of the local KYU and the University of Mackerel used the power of attraction, enthusiasm, and full spirit to interpret not only a warm dance, but also a nation which has been handed down by the West Africans for a hundred years. Ghost. The drums that will not stop, the tireless drummer shocked me. On the other hand, even students and teachers with higher education rely on melodies to sing in traditional music, and the notation is not applied. Subjectively, the learners' knowledge of music is relatively rare, and the deeper reason is the lack of resources for music teachers who can systematically teach. Talents are even rare in the integration of traditional music and Western music theory. At the end of the exchange program, the NYU and KYU teachers and students combined western modern ballet with African folk dance, which is a useful attempt to pass on music and dance. But how can one save and inherit under economic underdevelopment?</p>
     
      
      <h3 id="usa"> Amaggunju in the USA</h3>
      <p>By adapting and interpreting Uganda's traditional dance innovations, international cultural communicators have made dance itself a new connotation. The New York University students who participated in the exchange program grew up in the field of music and dance, and also promoted the spread of multiculturalism around the world. At the Black History Festival in New York, the adaptation of Amaggunju's performance was a great success, and the enthusiasm of the African grasslands left a deep impression on New Yorkers from around the world. "Different color, one people, another color, nice people", every dancer sings his country, Amaggunju interprets community music and dance and makes the whole world a big community. Cultural tolerance and cultural integration have given the traditional culture of a nation a new core. Also, a two-time dancer from the project caught my attention: As a part-time dance coach, she integrated African dance elements actively into the teaching of tap dancing and let Amaggunju inherit them in another form. However, as a recipient of traditional African culture, our onlookers and dance students can not fully understand the true meaning of Amaggunju: Amaggunju gradually lost its original color during the spread of overseas and conservative cultural heirs criticizing how a balance in inheritance and innovation can be achieved also a problem that needs to be further resolved. Also, overseas spread of traditional culture and in different cultural melting pot of New York.</p>

      <h3 id="china"> Amaggunju in China</h3>
      <p>Amaggunju in China have a significant interpretation and localization has commercial color. Through the project, I have explained a lot of good African dancers and drummers, they have special achievements at State Fair Qingdao Chinese City, Shandong Province and Chengdu, Sichuan Province. As a dancer and audience, I was surprised that Chinese pop songs were added to the performances and African actors interacted with the audience in Chinese. Two dancers magoba and comsamba represent Amaggunju's traditional royal dances of Africa, with easy to understand the performers for the Chinese audience of an understanding of African culture. However, the majority of Chinese audiences for the awareness of African dance are still stuck in the "crazy shakes" and "twisted ass", while the individual cultural science audience do and understand the traditional cultural practices on such popular culture is hard to express. In order to find a meeting place Chinese audience aesthetic and cultural traditions of music and dance in Africa, I am actively involved in the performances, China is a sense of familiarity with Chinese pop music as well as fresh Amaggunju, so that Chinese audiences full of praise , Traditional culture abroad spread and build an inclusive process that traditional music and dance localization and marketing to some extent become a permanent power of traditional cultural heritage, as the commercial value of traditional music to recognize and dance through the localization needs more exploration and work hard.</p>

      <h2> Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>of me</li>
        <li>of friend A who went to Uganda</li>
        <li>of friend B who never go to Uganda</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="thoughts_1"> Reflection of me</h3>
      <p>I feel very happy to communicate with (community building through teaching, creating, performing, dance education in Uganda) program . Cultural diversity and inclusiveness are reflected in this 13-year overseas exchange program. At the same time, as a local Chinese and a foreign student studying music education in the United States, studying local folk music and dancing in Uganda, West Africa, has given me more unexpected thoughts. Amaggunju is a unique Uganda folk dance that we study in-depth as part of the exchange project, where we explore the inheritance of the intangible cultural heritage of all ethnic groups in today's  society through the spread of this dance in the three countries China, USA and China.</p>
      <p>I think more people should understand this traditional music dance. The way in the spread of art and culture needs to be improved. As a learner, educator and observer, I found this meaningful project to bring to everyone. The impact is very large, enriching the world's material and cultural heritage. The value brought by the community's music and dance is immeasurable. It will help the future of music education and even create something similar to NYU. Exchange activities to pass on these traditional music and dance cultures so that everyone can re-recognize Uganda</p>

      <h3 id="thoughts_2"> Reflection of friend A who went to Uganda</h3>
      <p>A friend of the dance academy has already participated in this project twice. I asked her why she would participate twice. She said that because I love the people here, I enjoy the process very much. What the Ugandan people brought to him is Positive and optimistic attitude towards life, she is also proud of this group of lovely people, that they can do their best to help these children who are eager for art, for me is a wealth and value of life, is her It is impossible to feel in New York. For her, it’s not just a good experience, but a good memory.</p>
      <p>She is the Canadian Chinese who went to this project with me. The name is terisa. After reading my webpage, she felt very detailed about the original intention of our whole project. I think that describing amaggunju is very good, through video and first-hand information. Interpretation, there is no deviation from what we have learned before, this is also a kind of memory, and sharing this memory with everyone is a very good move.</p>

      <h3 id="thoughts_3"> Reflection of friend B who never go to Uganda</h3>
      <p>In China, many people are very strange to the three words of Uganda. Even if they know that they are a poor and backward country, a country that has not stopped fighting the smoke and smoke will have a great understanding of their art and culture. And hips, dance and music originated in Africa as a whole, but there are many universities in China that also have exchange programs, which will bring some resources in medical, military and economic fields. Most of the main objects are students. In New York, because of the black immigrants, some of their descendants are distributed in some parts of Africa. Some of the blacks know the culture and art of Uganda. Of course, some African artists have African dance and music in New York. Courses, each college will also open some African dance and drum courses and projects, some will have a certain understanding, will also open a special charity concert, the overall will know more than China.</p>
